# CTF Pocket Sand

Programs I've written here and there for simple tasks. They always get lost in
different folders across machines, so now I won't have to go digging for them
or rewrite them every time I need them.

They're meant to be opened up and fiddled with, and are often modified to fit
the exact needs of the puzzle I'm working on. That's why they're partially
populated with misc. data now.

caesar_and_rot13:

As it sounds. Three methods, a caesar encrypter / decrypter, a rot13 (which is
a caesar with a shift of 13), and a brute force shifter to do all 26 shifts at once.

monoalphabetic_substitution_cipher:

This program has three "helper" methods, because these can be tough to solve.
A character frequency analyzer, a doubles analyzer, and a word counter, all
things that come in handy when trying to solve monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.

ncl_python_reverse_engineer:

The NCL contest always has this same strange python program to take apart. Here's
a program I wrote that makes it easy to deconstruct in a hurry.

pascal_triangle:

Ok, not that useful, but just a fun exercise in recusrion from my first high school
CS class.

prime_numbers:

Haven't had to use this yet, but probably will sooner or later. Methods relating
to math of prime numbers, who could have guessed.

vigenere_cipher:

Another quick decryption program. the Vigenere cipher was created as an upgrade
from the easily brute forcable caesar cipher by using multiple different shifts,
allowing a now infinite number of keys (keys can be any length).

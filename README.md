# CTF Pocket Sand
By Khedron

![pocket sand](./references/pocket-sand-gif.gif)

A collection of useful little python scripts for when you just need to throw a quick handful of sand at a problem. The majority of these are 

1. Cryptography related (rail_fence, viginere_cipher) 
2. CTF types of tasks and utilities (RSA)
3. Miscellaneous scripts for personal practice or fun (prime_numbers, change). 

For Cryptography related files, most pull their ciphertext or input text from the "ciphertext" file in the references folder. Populate that file with your data before running cryptography programs.
